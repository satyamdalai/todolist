Hey There!

My name is Satyam Dalai and I am currently a final year undergraduate at Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University and have interest in programming, web development and data science. My preferred languages are Java and Python.

This is a simple ToDo List app I made using Python basics and used sqlalchemy to connect to database for storing my tasks. I would thank [Jetbrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org) for providing the learning opporunity.

### Steps to use:

1. Clone the repository
2. Launch the terminal and type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Run the program using "python todolist.py"

Suggestions are most welcome and hope you like it!!
